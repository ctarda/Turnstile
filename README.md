Turnstile is a lightweight implementation of a [Finite State Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) in Swift.

Turnstile is inspired by some of the existing open source implementations of State Machines in Swift, in particular:
* [Transporter](https://github.com/DenHeadless/Transporter)
* [SwiftyStateMachine](https://github.com/macoscope/SwiftyStateMachine)

Turnstile aims to be simple to use, while maintaning a clean API.

Turnstile builds as a framework, and therefore needs iOS 8.

Turnstile has been migrated to Swift 2, and therefore it requires Xcode 7.

## Usage

## Installation

Turnstile is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
